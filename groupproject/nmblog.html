               <h4>This pizza place was established in Flatiron in 1954 and it still has a brick oven in the back for the most authentic slice you will find in the city. This is a family establishment which has kept its recipe secret for decades. Try the classic Marghertia pizza. </h4>

            <h4>If you are feeling adventurous, look no further than this SoHo establishment that has over 24 different toppings so you can make fun combinations. We recommend the olive, goat cheese, and prosciutto and if you need a vegetarian option, spinach, hot banana peppers, and mozzarella is an awesome go-to.  </h4></div>

           <h4>New to the West Village but making some noise in the pizza game. I am running out of things to say about pizza because honestly, you just know a good slice when you know it and Nira's pie is it. Not only are they a pizzeria but they also are a bakery so if you want a cannoli after a fresh slice, this is the place to go.</h4>

Layers of pepperoni, spinch, and mozzarella in between two layers of delicious cheesy pizza. Why settle when you can have the pizza burger? Disclaimer: Not pictured because as you can imagine it is not the most photogenic.</h4></div>
